# CMSI-385-Final

Project: Implementation of a nondeterministic finite automaton(NFA) + a Turing Machine

Details: Using Node.js, I will carry out the instructions posted on Brightspace to create both a NFA Simulator and a Turing Machine Simulator by doing the following:

1. Accepting a machine description from either the (<) operator or via command line arguments
2. Validating the content of the description
3. Prompting for the string to be evaluated
4. Processing the string against the machine description
5. Prompting whether or not the string was accepted
