# CMSI-385-Final
Project: Implementation of a nondeterministic finite automaton(NFA)

Details: Using Node.js or C++(still deciding), I will carry out the instructions posted on Brightspace to create an NFA Simulator by doing the following:

1. Prompting for the location of the NFA description(file path)
2. Validating the content of the NFA description
3. Prompting for the string to be evaluated
4. Processing the string against the NFA description
5. Prompting whether or not the string was accepted
6. Prompting whether or not the user would like to evaluate another string(^C to exit)
